BoD winsupermaximize v1.00.

This program and its source are in the public domain.

This is a tiny utility that you can add to the quick launch area of the Windows taskbar.

When executed, it maximizes the currently active window, and resizes it so the title bar is actually above the screen boundaries, 
thus saving those extra pixels that you don't want to waste.
This is a bit like the "Full Screen" view in IE or Firefox when you press F11, but for any window.
When you execute it again it will bring back the window to its original size and position.
It also adds a shortcut (Windows key+F11) that does that.

Important: this works only if you set up your taskbar as "auto-hide". If you don't, the lower part of the window will actually be 
behind the taskbar. 

Tested only under Windows XP.
Tested only on a single screen setup.
This is actually an AutoHotkey script, compiled into an executable file (see http://www.autohotkey.com/).
